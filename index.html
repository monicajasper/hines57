        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>Tap dance originated around the turn of the 20th century in America. Many of the original greats were big in the 1900s to 1940s. Gregory Hines inherited the tradition of this original 'hoofer' style, emphasing rhythm over pomp.</p>
        <p>Hines was a big part of the revival movement in the 1980s and promoting tap in America. In 1989, Hines petitioned to get National Tap Dance Day created. On May 25, the day Bill (Bojangles) Robinson was born, the world celebrates the art of tap dance. Many get together and dance the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_Sham" target="_blank">Shim Sham Shimmy</a>.</p>

                 <p>"He sweeps about gently, and then lets loose with cataclysmic force; he takes big leaps and then tucks in his wings for a dazzling display of terpsichorean precision. The man is human lightning, and he just can't be contained."<br>
            &mdash;&nbsp;Frank&nbsp;Rich,&nbsp;1981</p>
          <p>"He purposely obliterated the tempos, throwing down a cascade of taps like pebbles tossed across the floor. In that moment, he aligned tap with the latest free-orm experiments in jazz and new music and postmodern dance."<br>
            &mdash;&nbsp;Sally&nbsp;Sommer,&nbsp;2003</p>
